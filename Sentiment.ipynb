    "\n",
    "This notebook conducts a sentiment analysis of earnings call transcripts and examines how the tone in the earning calls influences short-term stock market reactions. Sentiment is measured using the Loughran and McDonald (2018) financial dictionary, while the dependent variable cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) captures the market’s response around the event window. To isolate the effect of sentiment, the analysis includes control variables such as stock return volatility, firm size, leverage. \n",
